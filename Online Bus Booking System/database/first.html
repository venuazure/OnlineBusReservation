this conference will now be recorded

okay good morning guys

so today let's quickly uh go through

some of the slides and get into the uh

CI pipeline creation using Azure

pipelines okay

so as I said

these are the different uh

uh or I would say comprehensive list of

high level tasks that we need to do

to create a pipeline all the way from

connecting to core repository

environment setup dependency management

solution unit test cases code coverage

Etc right

and we use our classic editor we'll talk

about ml as well no one is there

and this is just a you know some

descriptions for you basically okay

but we already know we already already

know it okay

so how do you connect your code

repository so

uh I mean as I told you Azure reports is

based on uh your you know git right uh

but your Azure devops supports not only

Azure reports it will support other

source Control Management Systems as

well uh so it is very much possible in

any company that you know uh having

multiple SCM software Source control

management software so from here onwards

as I told you right I may use world word

called SCM or I may use it as a code

repository or I may use it as a Version

Control

I mean I mean any one of these three

words referring to the same escalate so

uh so we will we can connect with Azure

reports or get the coding git GitHub

which is a public and private as well

and uh you can keep code in bitbucket or

subversion it will support multiple uh

repositories basically so you can

connect to anything when you are

creating a CI pipeline

we will select a repo and then we'll

select the project basically okay it

doesn't matter right which software you

are using for sem your code will still

be the same

and then while setting up the

environment the second one so we have to

select the Microsoft hosted agent or

self hosted agent

okay

that is means it is nothing but your uh

you are selecting environment it is

basically a virtual machine or physical

machine where you have all the

prerequisite softwares basically to run

your work or to build your application

and then we will configure the agent

environment if it is uh dot net we will

select Ms build if it is a Java we will

select Maven and we also need to mention

Visual Studio or Eclipse Etc okay I'm

just giving you a quick run through so

that uh you can save it as a screenshots

Etc so that it is helpful for you when

you are revising it basically okay

and then there is some parallel

execution you know a criteria like you

know if I have a multiple jobs in my uh

multiple jobs in my same pipeline I can

execute them in parallel as well we'll

talk about what is that parallel

execution okay not now okay when we are

working on it we will talk about

it and then dependency management as you

know it's all about uh maintaining your

the developers reusable components some

of them are

automatically created by your Visual

Studio means whenever the software

installed all those components come with

that software like in a visual studio

software along with that basically it

basically Visual Studio downloads you

know your dotnet framework as well okay

in a nutshell okay or the reusable

components created by other developers

or other teams or external companies as

well they develop it and keep it in the

Nugget store and the developers can go

ahead and download from that nugget

store uh to use in their application or

in their.net projects okay so here you

can use a nuget which is a public one

and then Azure artifacts which is a

private one for us so both are same so

the way you are having a different

programming languages to develop web

application in the same way you have a

different software to manage your

artifacts as well so so you can develop

the same let us say you take a make

military application right you can

develop it in either.net either in Java

I mean it doesn't matter right but it's

all it all depends on you know the

company's preference or the availability

of the skill sets nothing more than that

so you can download all those

third-party packages or dlls whatever it

is from nougata Russia uh Azure

artifacts basically so again here also

here uh self so there is something you

need to remember self-hosted agents or

Azure artifacts reduce time to restore

okay

if you are using Azure let us say you

take you know yesterday we downloaded uh

one uh you know one dll right what is

the send greater data uh dll from nugget

okay imagine if you are downloading it

downloading it from nugget it may take

let us say some 10 seconds I'm just

giving an example some will take even

minutes as well so let us say it will

take 10 seconds but if you are taking it

from Azure artifacts it may take only

one second the reason your code is your

code your CI pipeline your environment

everything is in Azure devops and which

is in public Cloud right and on that

public Cloud Azure cloud is connected to

your network but nugget is a public

repository nobody gives you some SLA

right you will be able to download in

one minute Etc they don't give you and

again it has to come from internet and

it has to go through some security scans

in our infrastructure and then it has to

be downloaded so it takes some time so

if you use Azure article at the time

will be less

and then you have to have a task for

building the solution like compilation

so in our results today we'll go and

select a build solution menu at 100

similarly here you don't have Visual

Studio it is all portal right so you

have to select which IDE you need to use

Etc and then we'll configure some build

utilities our build utility is Ms bill

for dotnet and my one for Java

and there will be many other properties

as well

and then you need to run the unit test

cases so there should be some utility to

run the unit test case as well so we

will choose IDE version from the portal

is it a visual studio or you know Java I

mean

and then we'll there will be some test

criteria to be applied as well okay so

let us say you have a hundred test cases

unit test cases in your project in the

developers project so you you have an

option to use I mean how many what test

cases are to be run that means you know

uh just an example

if you are doing it if you are running

your CI pipeline for the first time you

may run all 100 unit test cases

okay but if you are running that uh same

CI pipeline 10 15 times a day okay what

you can do you can specify uh to run

only the impacted test cases unit that

means uh at nine o'clock I have run my

CI pipeline all 100 unit test cases are

one okay and at 10 o'clock again I am

going to run the CI pipeline at that

time you may you may specify an option

here

if some unit test case has been changed

in between 9 and 10 o'clock

you go and execute only those unit test

cases don't run all the unit test cases

so that means impacted unit test cases

can also can only be run you can have

that criteria basically why we need it

so it's a very simple reason

uh every one hour or every two hours if

if the developers are running the CI

pipeline right for that verification

this running this unit test cases may

take you know five minutes or 10 minutes

as well based on the number of unit test

cases available in the project but every

time if they have to wait for 10-15

minutes they get their productivity gets

reduced basically

so change you can configure your

pipeline to run only the impacted unit

test cases

okay

so you can also run some test cases in

in parallel as well let us say you have

100 unit test cases each in a test case

Matrix uh a minute if it is uh not

minute I would say some five seconds or

whatever it is right uh if you run I'm

just taking uh some number to explain

okay if you are 100 unit test cases is

taking 100 minutes if you make it

parallel always thought happens uh they

will run in one or two minutes right so

that's what parallel test excretion

so you will also you know configure for

reporting is by default you don't need

to do anything uh you can configure for

code coverage Etc

and there are many other properties okay

in the test idea are running in test

cases section

and then

the core coverage and quality Gates we

will set up sonar Cube

and then once you set up the sonar queue

we will we will need to configure uh

your project for the code coverage and

quality so we will add some solar Cube

tasks in our Pipeline and we will

configure task is nothing but an utility

but since it is a portal you don't see

any code right everything is text box or

drop down or something else right so

that's the reason you don't call utility

or you only call it as a task

configure code coverage and setup on the

config for Quality Gates Etc okay and

then finally once you've done everything

we will uh I mean your pipeline will

build the application and it will

generate the artifacts so you can call

you can store those artifacts so in your

bin folder you will see it right there

you will see only dll but you have other

components as well like HTML Etc so very

well still if it is ever local it is

storing in your local laptop right in

your seat driver do it wherever your

project is so if it is from devops CI

pipeline you have to start somewhere

like a nugget

but I know you can store it as a zip

file under

download it your local file or you can

store it in Azure artifacts

or you can use it in Azure pipelines

there is a it is a kind of you know uh

storage mechanism in the artifact task

basically so these are different ways

that you can store but we will store in

Azure pipelines only because that is uh

integrated with your Azure pipeline

okay and then later they will so I set

sonar keep setup right uh so I will show

you how to set up sonar cube in local

okay it's uh I mean it's not that

complicated but you know since we are

not in a network like you know I am

using my local laptop right and I should

uh and it doesn't have any static IP

address right and when you set up sonar

Cube it will obviously have a portal

some I mean let us say localhost slash

you know some 9000 Etc okay but that URL

cannot be used outside of my laptop

because it's not it doesn't have any DNS

so what I do I will show you the setup

in sonar Cube setting up the sonar cube

in local laptop but I use a SAS version

of sonar Cube for doing our work labs

basically SAS I mean I mean it's same

basically right software as a service

uh we pay for use I mean what we use

basically

we'll talk about this sonar Cube later

when we come there basically first let's

go and start with uh

uh start with the basic pipelines okay

so this is our project let's go to

online reservation system

then now let's go to pipelines so in the

pipeline main menu you have all these

things pipelines environments religious

releases for the CD pipelines for the CI

so I don't know why they mentioned you

know they should have mentioned the

build pipeline or something because this

is a main menu right under that again

you have the sub menu as a pipelines

they might have they should have given

it as some build pipeline or CA I don't

know whatever it is but that's okay we

can't do anything let's click on the

pipelines this is for continuous

integration

so automate your build and release

process using Wizard and go from cloud I

mean go from Cloud to code to cloud and

you you can read it create a pipeline

so as I told you in my slides right I as

I explained you can connect to any one

of these things so our code is in

Azure reposit so if you see here

if we select these options directly

it will go for like ml creation I am not

going for that because ml is a time

consuming so people okay let me explain

now since we are here so people always

you know uh be it in YouTube or be it in

some companies some people right they

always surface they always passionate

about using uh command line or a script

RNs some code to do their activities

okay

see if you don't have any option to do

it go ahead and do it

okay but you have if you have an option

then don't do it the reason

for a management or for any company it's

a time consuming activity

okay because uh if someone is using some

tool he may do it in one day if someone

is using uh some scripting or some

command line utilities for the same work

he may take it five days

and end of the day you don't know

whether you have written a perfect

script or code also

so so that's the reason companies invest

in you know uh tools and products right

okay uh see now you have this you know

earlier you only have the Jenkins and

before that you only have the uh

python scripting and false scripting for

the cicd pipeline now you see hundreds

of uh you know utilities one famous we

talked about right we have the atlasian

bit government atlassian uh bamboo and

the gitlab

you see many of the people use gitlab as

well it is similar to your Azure devops

and it is expensive right Azure devops

results expensive but why people are

investing it's all about productivity

basically but what some people do they

will

they will come here and still want to

use uh ml see there are some specific

scenarios where you need to use ml you

have to use it you don't have an option

uh but uh just for showing something you

cannot use a scripting and amole Etc

okay I'll give one more example

for kubernetes right for kubernetes you

need a ml

okay uh so for deploying your Docker

images okay for deploying your

containers Etc okay so there people use

ml okay I don't have any option I have

to write the ml code okay but

you have a many other products on top of

kubernetes like you know you might have

used car I mean her pivotal Cloud

Foundry how many people I mean heard of

it tcfs

you guys heard of it is here

pivotal Cloud Foundry let me show you

this is another product this is very

very you know uh famous One basically

okay many people use it I know you know

what is the beauty of this platform as a

service the software pivotal Cloud

Foundry

everything is you know menu based drag

and drop so if someone is uh you know

maintaining their kubernetes uh a you

might have seen like this right I shown

you earlier isn't it

in our initial classes the same version

I've shown you okay

uh so if you are doing your Ram uh you

are deploying or you know or creating

darker images or you know some VMS in

some some other uh

platform Arena using mlr using

command line you may take you know uh

three four days but if you come to

pivotal Cloud country everything is uh

Auto managed you just need to go and

configure some of the you know

properties and you need to know how to

maintain the pivotal Clause boundary so

so companies will benefit from the you

know come in the let's say Force

basically so that's the reason it will

have a lot of cost savings

so it's all about productivity and

Effectiveness basically not about how

intelligent you are me so I'm just

giving some an example we keep talking

about it while we are working on this CI

CD pipelines Powershell okay and uh I

also give you you know Basics about

kubernetes as well right

so I will go and use the classic editor

if someone still want to learn ml there

is a way what is that way

you can use a classic editor

to you know to create your pipeline and

it will generate basically ml as well

you can go and read the timer so that is

the easiest way to do it basically okay

Emily is case sensitive and it is a

space sensitivity as well space is also

important okay

so uh we'll keep talking about it uh

throughout our course so let's go to our

first step so I selected a classic

editor and here it is asking me what uh

where is your code my code is in Azure

reposit and obviously there will be n

number of projects right so I will

select a online team reservation at the

time being in my your planner I have

only one project online reservation

system there are multiple you will see

multiple so

oh so in our project also there will be

a number of repositories right so what

is our repository name is it a online

reservation system or even I guess our

repository is your journalist

right so let me

let me open it a new tab

yeah this is our uh your Journeys okay

so let's uh use it a release pipeline

okay RCI pipe it is CI right you can do

it on anything basically so I can take

my main as well that's not a problem but

for CD you have to when you are doing

the CD pipeline right uh you have to do

it from uh you know when you are

deploying it you have to do it from

release I mean release for uh release

Branch basically

okay let me see

branches

so I have the ideal I have main Etc okay

since it is only CI pipeline I can take

a Dev or master or anything but uh so

this CI pipeline uh artifacts will not

be used for uh deploying let us think

that your developers are using it for

their day-to-day purpose okay but when a

devops engineer needs to develop I mean

deploy the artifacts we will go and

select the release folder okay because

that is a branching strategy most of the

times any companies use it okay

so I can take any branch here from the

bottom

you can work on any any one of these

things for the time being to make it

simple we'll start with the master

Branch because I need to explain few

more Concepts on top of the branches

what we select here as well we'll start

with the master

continue and the beauty of your any

platform be it git lab be it Azure

devops be it AWS devops be it uh uh you

know atlasian bamboo theme City Etc any

one of these platforms or platform as a

service or software as service right

they give you the templates for all the

different different application types

what you have you see you see with the

node.js

so there are compilers node.js with

grand node.js with girl

okay and then you have xamarian it is

for mobile development from the

Microsoft and you can use even Jenkins

as well to you know to cure Jenkins job

as well from here also you can do it

okay so that much service created this

Azure devops and then you can use Azure

web apps this is one of I explained what

is azure web app in our initial sessions

we will use this one as well okay in the

later sessions and then

asp.net core asp.net okay

you have a python xcode Dockers okay you

have all the templates okay now my

application yeah

information on which template do you

need to use the provided by the

development team

no they don't tell you right they will

tell you whether whether it is a desktop

application or you you need to ask a is

it a web application or a desktop

application obviously

you will come to know if someone is the

moment they run an application from

browser that is a web application right

I mean that that is as simple as that we

don't need to worry about it okay uh if

you don't know you can ask them

basically is it a I mean is it a Windows

desktop application or a web application

that's it

so

mine is a asp.net web application okay

even apis also comes under web only

because apis uh it doesn't have UI

that's it right but that is again web

right you can access it over Internet

isn't it

so whether it is an API or a HTML web

application with HTML or CS HTML it is

it comes under web application so mine

is asp.net apply it

so it will add see it will give you all

the

uh

I mean environment which is required to

run the basic pipeline basically after

that we will change it we will configure

it for our needs okay so by default if

you see

a pipeline is created for you which is

ready to be used basically okay uh we

will go and customize it for our next

but let's have a quick look into this

one okay

so this all this is created based on our

project type so Azure devops has got

that I mean I mean intelligence

basically

it will go on look into the Your

solution file and the project file it

will identify

what type of project it is okay and it

will go and add all those things

automatically so what is the first item

we have let me change this uh in a

description so online reservation system

I would say

uh I mean actually it is already

beautiful I mean it is it is saying hey

your project is online reservation

system and it is uh of asp.net and this

is a CI pipeline it is already named

very nice but if you have some naming

convention uh in your company you can

always go on to change it basically okay

I'm just leaving it as because it is

just a name okay after that your

pipeline when you when you click on

Pipeline on the right hand side you see

all the details this is the name of your

pipeline and agent pool okay this is

where we were talking about right uh is

it a Microsoft hosted as in or is it a

self host region if you click this

so you have a hosted and private private

means your self-hosted agent okay right

now there are no agents in the default

default is the name of your self-hosted

agent okay and inside a bracket you see

there are no agents that means nothing

is configured hosted means it is

Microsoft hosted agent the so its name

is azure pipelines that means when you

run the when you save this configuration

and queue the build queuing is nothing

but running your compilation basically

okay when you cured your code is going

to copy to this uh some VM in this Azure

pipelines pool and it uh it the code

will be copied and it will be built

there you will not see it but you can

see the logs

okay

and then you have to specify what has to

be I mean

these are the available uh agents means

uh

sorry can you go on mute

if you are developing some mac uh

Apple related stuff like a swift Renault

so you develop an I mean Apple related

applications using uh Swift okay mostly

basically or objective c okay you will

go and select a Mac OS as a agent that

means it is a VM inside I mean in the

back end anything related to Linux you

may go with the Ubuntu

okay Ubuntu is a flavor of Linux you

might annoying so visual studio 2017 uh

win 2016 that means this is for older

versions of dotnet uh okay which is

based on 2016 operating system 2017. you

also select Windows 2019 and windows

2022 as well I don't think anybody is

using 2022 I think this is just a

preview if I fail okay so let's go ahead

and select Windows 2019 okay you will

have extensive documentation on this to

read it Windows 2019 is nothing but uh

in the back end

it will create a virtual machine some

with the windows 2019 server or

something on top of that it will install

the visual studio 2019 required runtime

basically okay we can't see it so you

have the environment setup after that it

will copy all the code to that

to build it

I'm telling you what happens in the

background okay

and then it is asking you hey give me a

path to build your solution so by

default it will give you wild card

because it doesn't know right what is

the solution file name Etc so that's why

it is a star star slash starters sln

that means it will go to the root of

your Repository

and take the solution file that's our

star dot cell sln but you can since we

know it we can go and select it so this

is your repository and then under that

you have the your Journeys web and then

unit test okay let's go ahead and select

a solution

okay it doesn't have a

API okay that's okay we will create one

more pipeline

with that uh project you know in there

which contains both API and uh I know

your web project okay so he selected the

solution which which have to be compiled

or built actually and then artifact name

okay this is the where you once your

application is compiled in which folder

you need to save this articles okay so

by default it will create a folder with

name called drop okay you can change it

as well that's not a problem but it will

not show you where it is getting stored

it is all you know uh invisible to you

so right now we are doing a lot of work

here you don't know right where it is

getting saved because for you it is just

an application similarly your artifacts

will be stored in Azure pipelines uh

there is a storage mechanism or a

storage name under that it will create a

folder called drop and uh store all your

build artifacts into there into that

actually okay that's about

pipelines all you do all you have done

is uh some name change and agent pool

selection and your solution translation

after that this is all what you selected

in get sources this is all what you

selected while you're creating a

pipeline okay you can see we are doing

it on the master

okay and this is team project repository

and then you see some options here

uh clean uh right now it is uh false uh

you remember in Visual Studio you can

I've shown you an option to clean the

solution as well

that means uh whatever is generated in

the bin folder or any other invisible or

temporary files will be deleted if you

use that clean option by default it will

be true uh false you can make it true so

this is very helpful uh I mean if you

see now whenever you come you run your

pipeline right if you see any issues

relatable first you can do this so that

you will come to know if there are any

issues

Etc I will save only my source only okay

but it is not visible to you okay what

happens okay

you can tag the resources basically tag

is nothing but you know in your repos

if I go to my boards Etc

if you open any one of these things

right

so right now in this uh on the related

work what you see in any way you will

see your child's and parents and it will

also show you some you know uh release

information uh in which release this has

been gone so all the when you run

something here right in this build

pipeline or release pipeline this this

will be tagged in your you know

uh in your work items are in your

reports as well it will be shown

nothing more than that

right now everything is empty when I run

when I start running those things you

can see it here basically see uh when

you do some it will the way it is

showing all these branching information

Etc you will see about your I know build

and utilize pipelines as well right now

everything is empty that's about that I

will say uh

foreign

it is going to

tag those sources with this format

build.build numbers guys if you see

anything like this a dollar starting

with a dollar

and then uh something inside your

brackets sorry

something inside your bracket that means

this is a variable so right now what you

see is a Azure devops system variables

so there are variables available to

fetch the information about your

pipelines basically So when you say

build that build number for every uh if

you go to code reposited for every

commute it will generate one commit

number right one commit ID similarly

for every build it will generate one

build number let us say it might be when

you do it for the first time it could be

one after that two three four etcetera

so build that build number means it will

take the build number build number of

this build and then tag it actually okay

that's about it

you will learn about it okay

and then these are all you know

self-explanatory uh obviously we need to

report this build statuses okay uh we'll

let's not talk about all these things

now okay just stop it here okay and then

agent job

this is what you selected on the top

right whatever you selected here the

agents will come here actually so I'll

give the job name as you know let us say

uh web web basically because I'm

compiling web application okay and all

the agent pool information inherited

from pipeline from here right whatever

you selected

basically comes here okay and in the

bottom you see demands I was telling

right hey it will create a VM in uh I

mean in the back end and it will install

all the prerequisities as you see

uh your Azure devops are Azure pipelines

is the intelligent enough to identify

what is to be included in that agent so

it is including Ms Bill visual studio

and vs test because I have some test

assemblies as well

it includes all the electricities if

there is something extra required we can

go and add it as we will talk about it

and then parallelism

so right now I have only one agent here

that means one job here so I can go and

add a n number of jobs basically uh more

than one job to this pipeline okay so

when I have more than one job I can run

parallely as well multi-agent okay multi

configuration and none right now I'm not

selecting because I'm starting with a

simple pipeline okay

uh

so timeout timeout is nothing but you

know sometimes what happens uh your uh

when you save and queue it it may take

uh two three minutes uh to start as well

sometimes it may take five minutes

sometimes it does many of the time it

doesn't take any time to start basically

so but you never know uh it cannot be

unlimited time right infinite time right

you basically keep here time out let us

say when you click on Save and queue if

it you know if it takes more than one

minute time out the job means it will it

will abort the job that is the thing you

are giving it action so you can read it

okay and job cancel timeout you can

cancel the job itself and then

dependencies as well okay right now I

have only one job but if I have multiple

jobs in this same pipeline I can add a

job you can see I mean how do I add a

job you can go to pipeline this is the

parent

go and add an agent job

then I will have another job I can name

it as a I click this

I'll take it as well

API

okay uh

there is nothing added because I I don't

I did not specify anything for this okay

so what is this uh dependencies

so I want to run this job

only

after my API job is

executed such kind of uh

sequencing criteria I can put it that is

called jobs I mean dependencies so most

of the times what happens uh you might

be having this web application as some

API application but it may need some

prerequisities to be built basically

such in such kind of cases you will use

this dependencies you will ask about hey

what is the sequence that I need to

build it if those developers may tell

you hey first run this and then you have

to run this like that in those cases you

will use the dependencies okay finally

you have this some conditions we'll talk

about these conditions like when you run

this job okay you have options when all

previous jobs exceed uh succeeded all

previous jobs have succeeded even if

your previous job has failed Etc there

are three four options and custom

condition as well I will explain it uh

when we do customize it heavily

and then find also all we've done is a

prerequisites now this is where uh your

dependency management comes into picture

so it added a task this these are all

the tasks okay

pipeline under pipeline you will have a

number of jobs under each job you will

have a task these are all the tasks okay

what is this task about so you will see

some you know task version Etc so

obviously task is nothing but a utility

there will be a number of questions

available but don't worry by default it

will take the

greatest basically which is working or

which is stable okay

and you see the yaml as well here

okay

so if you are using AML basically to

create your pipeline

just for this task you need to add these

many statements okay steps under that

steps you have the task as you know this

one okay and display name what you see

here and then inputs

it's like this you need to use it okay

so I'm going to use the latest version

of 441 and this is my task display name

okay

when you specify this right what happens

your comp your pipeline knows where to

go and look for uh references of the

project basically okay

so this control options and output

variables

these two sections will be available in

each and every task these are the common

sections basically or common

configurations uh across all the tasks

so you will see it in everything

we'll talk about this as well tomorrow

when we are customizing it more this is

just a tool okay

and then negate register okay I

mentioned uh my pipeline to use nuget

but I also need to mention what command

to be used right so so there is a

command that this nuget is going to use

or this pipeline is going to use

basically so there are multiple commands

restore pack push custom we are going to

use a restore command the reason uh I uh

in my project I have some

dependencies to be downloaded one is

send grid and some are some system

related so downloading is nothing but

restore basically okay we use a restore

command okay

path to solution this is already I

selected in the top that's the reason

your solution file has come okay and uh

all the

the usable components that you will see

in the nuget store will be called as a

Fields basically each and every reusable

com component will be called as a feed

okay

in uh artifacts terminology okay so

Fields I select here feeds in my nuget

DOT config these are the two options

okay fits I select here what feed I want

to select I want to

select this and then use packages from

nuget data so this is what is their

configured in a visual studio okay and

there will be some Advanced options guys

uh

these are about caching Etc we talk

about and you see control options and

output variables again here you see here

you see here as well and you will see in

each and every task as I told you you

see control options and output variables

okay now what is there in the build

solution

so it is all about building your

uh solution right with all the projects

so it is saying hey take this solution

it is grayed out because I selected in

the top

if you want to edit make it editable you

click on this bangle icon if you click

this you will have option unlinked

okay

so I'm saying use the latest version of

Visual Studio to build my application in

the CI pipeline okay if you want any

specific version you can select

basically let's use the latest version

2019 or latest both are same

and by default it has added all these Ms

build arguments okay this is the beauty

of these things otherwise if you are

using a git uh sorry if you are using

Jenkins in older days even in Jenkins

nowadays right they are also providing a

template like this it will go and I'll

add all these uh you know parameters uh

arguments is nothing but parameter right

if you are not using uh any platforms

like this you need to go and you know

understand about all these things this

you call it as a switches or arguments

whatever you call it okay

it's not only about Ms Bill if you are

using any utility which is command line

you have to use all these switches right

even in Ms Das or Linux this is how you

send the arguments to the command side

so deploy and build this to web publish

uh method is package package as a single

file skip invalid configurations and

package locations package location means

once it is done where it is going to

store your artifacts it is going to be

storing in a location called artifacts

to staging directory these are standard

basically deploy and Bill means it is

saying hey once you build is successful

you want to deploy you know we don't it

won't deploy basically here deployment

deployment is nothing it's not about

deploying your code to servers it's

about copying to this location web

publish method is a package and a single

file package as a single file is true

that means once you compile it each and

every artifact generated from your you

know uh Solution by our compilation will

be

will be stored as a single file means

it's a zip file basically in that in

that zip file uh it will you call it as

a package this method basically it is a

zip package that's what it is basically

okay uh that's a beauty you don't need

to worry about it automatically gets

generated based on the project type what

you have and then we have a build

platform variable

and configuration variable this is what

you see in Visual Studio when you right

click on the properties right if you

want to see what is where this variable

is you know uh created you can come to

the variable section

here build configuration is a release

mode build platform is necessary I told

you right if you are if you are

compiling your application from Visual

Studio go and select the debug mode but

if you are doing it from for a CI

pipeline purpose or a deployment purpose

see how it is a release mode if you use

a debug mode many temporary files will

be created but if you use a release mode

no temporary files will be created which

are not required for your application

basically and these are all you know uh

some metadata which you don't need to

worry about it

and then again you see advanced

okay

after that uh

you have built-in parallel restore

negate Packages Etc we already have it

and then control options and variables

similarly test assemblies is also a.net

project right it is

in Google solution

create log file not required

I mean you can select it I mean it will

be the by default you have all the

information Okay so

you can you can basically select I mean

you need a minimal information or you

know you need a detailed information you

need a Diagnostics Etc okay Danish means

it is very low level details it will

show you each and every step of your uh

you know build basically

okay okay uh it will increase the

storage even if you go to MS-DOS or you

know scripting or unique scripting or

Linux scripting you will always have

these options uh when you're running the

commands as well you have an option

right wordpose it will give you when you

run the command basically to get the

command point it will not give you any

log but when you go and specify these

things it will show you a lot of

information about that command basically

I mean will it will this log report be

useful if any error occurs like whether

frankly to speak we don't need at that

level I will show you when you run this

one you will already you will see a log

base currently okay okay this is about

your system information obviously we use

x86 right who is using x64 x64 means

your 32-bit

yeah right a little bit uh I don't think

anyone is having 30 debate from last

seven eight years everything is

what is it

x86 is a

no I don't think so okay

this is always a confusion to me

32-bit because we don't read it right

x64 refers to 64 bits 64-bit CPU and

then uh

we need to read it man I always get

confused basically

yeah x86 is 32

okay

okay so this would be 64 bit should we

go with 64 by default

all right right but uh so but what I see

uh whether it is 86 as 64 it doesn't

make system but uh there are some

programming languages let us say you are

working on some Android API Android apps

or you know or uh are some com level

components it's a world ribbon let us

say uh you are using uh let us say WPF

okay WPF is uh I know it's a win uh

desktop desktop like application

basically but it is rich in UI if you go

on the user normal desktop application

the UI will be normal if you use a WPF

it will give you a glossy look and feel

kind of stuff all the rich controls will

be there there basically gets installed

in your desktop so it really matters

whether you are using 32-bit or 64-bit

okay but these are the web applications

where it is going to be stored in a I we

are going to deploy them in a IIs

internet information service cases ah so

that is a software on top of your

operating system right that will

abstract all these issues like a x86 or

x64

okay

but uh you can give attention when

you're working on that kind of desktop

application but for a web I don't think

it it's a matter basically okay okay

log history you can specify it you can

specify the versions I mean how you want

to store this around you can leave it

I'm just giving a run through today so

you have control options and output

variables it is same for a as I told you

that for all the

tasks okay

and if you go to test assemblies again

you will see a name but here you see hey

select the tests using test assemblies

or other options here test plan and test

run so test plan and test run are part

of your I mean which are done by your

auto I mean your test testing team

basically but what we are doing is a

white box unit test cases which is part

of our

our project basically unit test cases so

for that you need to select test

assembly assembly is nothing but a dll

okay

that's the reason we select test

assemblies

and uh you know it is very intelligent

you see the project name you need to

provide right

it uh it is giving you know star test

star star test STAR dot dll because uh

how we name our Visual Studio Projects

you know obviously will if it is a test

project we will keep a word called test

actually that's the reason it is giving

but if you want to give it if there are

multiple if there are some projects with

the test as well then it will conflict

basically so the better way you go and

look for the project name okay where I

can see you can go to sources

or you can go to

uh you can go to Red Cross site

give the project name because most of

the times we we don't use testing the

project name for all the projects but in

some cases you may use it you never know

right what people use it so

our project name is this one

okay this is a project name but when you

compile it what dll will be generated uh

your Journeys web dot tests Dot dll

okay that is the output basically

I explained it yesterday okay

so

go to Solutions only

replace this path

that's it and then okay

here is

just in case if you are a solution is

having some projects with this word okay

so that you will not create a you know

conflict

and then these are all by default you

don't need to worry about these things

this is for your pipeline not for your

configuration okay your results where it

will store and I was talking about some

test fill the criteria right in our in

our slide we'll talk about it uh

tomorrow day after tomorrow Etc okay all

these things will talk about it uh

tomorrow day after tomorrow okay

and then uh uh we generally use this

baseball basically we will uh you know

can disable or delete it actually you

can disable or you can delete it

for the timing Let It Be and finally

publish artifacts that means uh very uh

you need to copy your artifact set it is

going to be saved in the artifact

staging directive uh you you never see

it basically all you see is this folder

name draw we already given this name in

the top right that's why it has come

here okay and where is the location this

folder will be available in a location

called Azure Pipelines

okay and these are all again uh your

common things there will be Advanced

okay

so uh tar the artifact before uploading

I think this is for the Unix or

something okay so but these are all the

options the task that you have

for your asp.net web application by

default you got it basically okay uh we

will you know basically we will go and

customize all these things from tomorrow

so for the time being let's go and save

it

okay it is saved now go on the Queue it

basically Q is nothing but starting the

build okay let's go on the queue

it is basically confirmation okay is

this information is this right R1 okay

and you see enable system diagnetics it

is also giving an option here okay I'm

not selecting it for the timing just run

it

so it is showing you all the metadata

hey what is your repository and project

what is the last latest commit ID when

it is started how much time it took uh

what are the work items that are

included

is it enable for test and coverage okay

people can see the changes as well

now okay I got some error no

no hosted parallel has been purchased or

granted uh

I think my what I say my free credits

are over

uh this is let me did I select a

parallel

all right

so basically you know uh you will get

free hours to run your jobs basically

free means uh

when you create your organization first

you will you will get some 1800 minutes

of free time to run your jobs for a

month basically after that uh your 1800

minutes will be over then you will be

charged basically okay let me see what

is the issue for me is it uh my credits

expiration or is it something else okay

so you will not see this issue if you

are using your organization one because

obviously it will the quota will not be

free right it is paid okay let me go and

uh go to my pipeline

and edit it actually click this

edit the pipeline

go to agent let us select any

parallelism here no nothing here I did

not select any parallel

let me take this remove this

uh

remove

okay I have only one let me save it

my credits might have been expired as

well or I don't have a free credits I

need to enable it okay

no hosted parallelism has been purchased

or granted to request a free parallel

parallelism Grant okay

okay guys from last

in the last five six months basically

you know these guys Microsoft earlier

provided uh three credits by default

basically okay I think from the last

five six months they changed it they are

not giving free by default basically so

we need to request for it okay we can

troubleshoot it but I since I know it

you can basically

you can see the error here it will guide

you what it is uh what is the problem

okay

I don't have the free credits let me

copy this okay

copy

so what this guy is saying hey please

fill out this following form

for free credit that's what it is saying

so you go here our other one is you can

email as well okay

there is an email available

so give your name email address email

address that you are using for your

Azure devops okay and you have to give

the organization name how do you get the

organization name

you go here and uh

till this place basically

your root URL and your organization name

okay let me put it here what is it put

it

my organization okay

and then let's say

it's by I guess X

what is the name I'm using there okay

what's your email ID

score 86.

you do as I told you don't need it if

you are using paid version I'm trying to

use free that's why okay

are you requesting a parallel increase

for public or private projects I would

say private

okay public means anyone can see it okay

and then finally

save it foreign

is it

yeah we can see only the first part like

what is your name

okay I actually submitted as well just

let me know if it is refreshed yeah

okay just a name right you can take it

that's a self-explanatory taking the

organization name okay

I shown you how to take the organization

right this is the first part

yeah okay

all right click on this or when you

click on it you will get the similar

thing here when you click on the

organization

okay you just take it and do we also

need to have credits to check this uh

things at all right yeah actually I tell

you uh till January or February this was

not the case basically

okay

from January or February they started

this one looks like many people started

using it right okay uh they see when

you're running something obviously you

are using their infrastructure isn't it

so it's an expensive for them but if I

go to my other organizations right let

me go to online travel

okay

this is my other organization if I go

here any of these projects I think I

should be able to create a pipeline

the reason

this is not my this is my older uh you

know what I say

old organization before this role has

come up basically okay

I'm I'm quickly doing something you see

okay

I think I should be able to

save and queue I'm not doing anything

I'm just trying to see basically

uh if I want to see Lux I can click this

if I click it I will see all the locks

what is happening

now it is trying to acquire an agent

from the code Cloud basically

it is

yeah you see

the bill started this year right

yes

yeah it is a complete clock for say as I

told you right I created my other

organization before January

okay I mean last year I created that

organization

okay for all the new organizations what

people are creating after January or

February they are asking us to create a

request so that they will go and enable

that free credits for you basically

okay uh you know recently some of my you

know old batch guys were asking hey it

is giving me here that but the problem

you know they were not uh reading the

error basically what is that okay after

they send that you know request I think

in one or two days uh they were they

were enabling it okay I think you can do

that today itself okay so that by

tomorrow or you know adapter tomorrow

you will get that enabled okay

you see now in my older organization it

is happening but in a new organization

this is where I am having them because I

just created yesterday

okay

so let me go back there uh online travel

and then Clips I can see my pipeline is

completed go to Pipelines

this is still going on it is running

basically it will give you all the

information

it's a done almost basically

okay guys this is just a tour of however

CI pipeline looks like okay so uh

tomorrow we will go in detail and we'll

customize as well you see uh in the

bottom right you see the artifact is

produced one artifact is produced okay

if you click this it is showing 100 unit

test case 100 test pass I don't have any

unit test cases okay

what is that

when you click on this this is the drop

folder it will contain all the artifacts

basically they were I have some web I

have some micro services and rest

everything is the system generated

because you will use the same artifact

to deploy to the IIs basically since it

is a web application so It prepares your

CI Bible knows that you know these are

required when you are replying to the

some server basically

okay so we'll go in detail tomorrow

uh

will work on that okay to go through I

mean the configuration or customization

okay guys

you know uh can you help us to I mean uh

uh do we also need to request for uh the

parallel yeah yeah what you do what can

we just uh

no no what you do you do it today itself

you create an organization right okay uh

let me give you that URL I got that URL

right

so that you will go and submit

where I can find that URL this is my

online reservation system I got that

I can go to the pipelines okay this is

scale red go here

open any one of these things

and click on this okay

uh it's already in the notepad right

okay

create an organization and use that in

your

let me put it in the chat okay

okay so how do we

get the free credits

okay that's right once you uh we have we

have the organization Creator right once

you put it your organization

uh uh in that uh request right

application I mean in that web form they

will give you they will enable it

actually they will enable it for you

okay okay

so that we can see you know you go to

the organization

organization settings I shown you

earlier when we were talking about these

things users

where is that

this some place where you see all the

free stuff please I mean how many

credits are there that's in the jobs

sorry

I say this is where you see basically

right now I have a zero Microsoft worded

in zero basically if I have something it

will tell me the time as well how much

time you you have it basically 18 time

means it's not like when you start and

when you it's not about that actually uh

it's about the time it takes to run this

so right now it taken one minute 51

seconds right that means I can use it

1800 times basically 1800 minutes will

be coming for free for you

okay that it will be shown there so

first you do I pasted that URL there uh

submit your request with this with your

organization name complete organization

your Dev dot azure.com your organization

when you click here

you will get this URL

okay

that's simple I've shown you right

that's very simple

you got the URL in the chat you will put

it okay yeah do it after this one takes

hardly one minute right

okay guys that's it for today uh we'll

catch up tomorrow

for more advanced questions okay

okay thank you
